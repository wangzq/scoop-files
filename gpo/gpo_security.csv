This security setting determines the period of time (in days) that a password can be used before the system requires the user to change it. You can set passwords to expire after a number of days between 1 and 999, or you can specify that passwords never expire by setting the number of days to 0. If the maximum password age is between 1 and 999 days, the Minimum password age must be less than the maximum password age. If the maximum password age is set to 0, the minimum password age can be any value between 0 and 998 days.

Note: It is a security best practice to have passwords expire every 30 to 90 days, depending on your environment. This way, an attacker has a limited amount of time in which to crack a user's password and have access to your network resources.

This security setting determines the period of time (in days) that a password must be used before the user can change it. You can set a value between 1 and 998 days, or you can allow changes immediately by setting the number of days to 0.

The minimum password age must be less than the Maximum password age, unless the maximum password age is set to 0, indicating that passwords will never expire. If the maximum password age is set to 0, the minimum password age can be set to any value between 0 and 998.

Configure the minimum password age to be more than 0 if you want Enforce password history to be effective. Without a minimum password age, users can cycle through passwords repeatedly until they get to an old favorite. The default setting does not follow this recommendation, so that an administrator can specify a password for a user and then require the user to change the administrator-defined password when the user logs on. If the password history is set to 0, the user does not have to choose a new password. For this reason, Enforce password history is set to 1 by default.

This security setting determines whether the operating system stores passwords using reversible encryption.

This policy provides support for applications that use protocols that require knowledge of the user's password for authentication purposes. Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing plaintext versions of the passwords. For this reason, this policy should never be enabled unless application requirements outweigh the need to protect password information.

This security setting determines the maximum time difference (in minutes) that Kerberos V5 tolerates between the time on the client clock and the time on the domain controller running Windows Server 2003 that provides Kerberos authentication.

To prevent ""replay attacks,"" Kerberos V5 uses time stamps as part of its protocol definition. For time stamps to work properly, the clocks of the client and the domain controller need to be in sync as much as possible. In other words, both computers must be set to the same time and date. Because the clocks of two computers are often out of sync, administrators can use this policy to establish the maximum acceptable difference to Kerberos V5 between a client clock and domain controller clock. If the difference between a client clock and the domain controller clock is less than the maximum time difference that is specified in this policy, any time stamp that is used in a session between the two computers is considered to be authentic.

This security setting determines whether the OS audits each time this computer validates an account¡¯s credentials.

Account logon events are generated whenever a computer validates the credentials of an account for which it is authoritative.  Domain members and non-domain-joined machines are authoritative for their local accounts; domain controllers are all authoritative for accounts in the domain. Credential validation may be in support of a local logon, or, in the case of an Active Directory domain account on a domain controller, may be in support of a logon to another computer. Credential validation is stateless so there is no corresponding logoff event for account logon events.

This security setting determines whether all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member must be signed or encrypted.

When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After that, when the system starts, it uses the computer account password to create a secure channel with a domain controller for its domain. This secure channel is used to perform operations such as NTLM pass through authentication, LSA SID/name Lookup etc.

This setting determines whether or not all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member meets minimum security requirements. Specifically it determines whether all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member must be signed or encrypted. If this policy is enabled, then the secure channel will not be established unless either signing or encryption of all secure channel traffic is negotiated. If this policy is disabled, then encryption and signing of all secure channel traffic is negotiated with the Domain Controller in which case the level of signing and encryption depends on the version of the Domain Controller and the settings of the following two policies:

Domain member: Digitally encrypt secure channel data (when possible)

This security setting determines whether the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing with clients that request it.

The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for Microsoft file and print sharing and many other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that modify SMB packets in transit, the SMB protocol supports the digital signing of SMB packets. This policy setting determines whether the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet signing when an SMB client requests it.

If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the client. That is, if packet signing has been enabled on the client, packet signing will be negotiated. If this policy is disabled, the SMB client will never negotiate SMB packet signing.

Default: Enabled on domain controllers only.

Important

For Windows 2000 servers to negotiate signing with Windows NT 4.0 clients, the following registry value must be set to 1 on the server running Windows 2000: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\parameters\enableW9xsecuritysignature

Notes

All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. To take advantage of SMB packet signing, both the client-side SMB component and server-side SMB component that are involved in a communication must have SMB packet signing either enabled or required. For Windows 2000 and above, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings:
Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing.
Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component requires packet signing.
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.
If server-side SMB signing is required, a client will not be able to establish a session with that server unless it has client-side SMB signing enabled. By default, client-side SMB signing is enabled on workstations, servers, and domain controllers.
Similarly, if client-side SMB signing is required, that client will not be able to establish a session with servers that do not have packet signing enabled. By default, server-side SMB signing is enabled only on domain controllers.
If server-side SMB signing is enabled, SMB packet signing will be negotiated with clients that have client-side SMB signing enabled.
Using SMB packet signing can impose up to a 15 percent performance hit on file service transactions.

This security setting determines whether to disconnect users who are connected to the local computer outside their user account's valid logon hours. This setting affects the Server Message Block (SMB) component.

When this policy is enabled, it causes client sessions with the SMB Service to be forcibly disconnected when the client's logon hours expire.

The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for file and printer sharing and many other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. The SMB protocol supports validating the SMB server service principal name (SPN) within the authentication blob provided by a SMB client to  prevent a class of attacks against SMB servers referred to as SMB relay attacks.  This setting will affect both SMB1 and SMB2.
 
This security setting determines the level of validation a SMB server performs on the service principal name (SPN) provided by the SMB client when trying to establish a session to an SMB server.
 
The options are:
 
No validation - validation of the SPN will not be performed by the SMB server.
 
Validate if provided by client - the SMB server will validate the SPN provided by the SMB client and allow a session to be established if it matches the SMB server¡¯s list of SPN¡¯s for itself.  If the SPN does NOT match, the session request for that SMB client will be denied.
 
Require match from client - the SMB client MUST send a SPN name in session setup, and the SPN name provided MUST match the SMB server that is being requested to establish a connection.  If no SPN is provided by client, or the SPN provided does not match, the session is denied.
 
Default: No validation

This security setting determines how network logons that use local accounts are authenticated. If this setting is set to Classic, network logons that use local account credentials authenticate by using those credentials. The Classic model allows fine control over access to resources. By using the Classic model, you can grant different types of access to different users for the same resource.

If this setting is set to Guest only, network logons that use local accounts are automatically mapped to the Guest account. By using the Guest model, you can have all users treated equally. All users authenticate as Guest, and they all receive the same level of access to a given resource, which can be either Read-only or Modify.

Virtual memory support uses a system pagefile to swap pages of memory to disk when they are not used. On a running system, this pagefile is opened exclusively by the operating system, and it is well protected. However, systems that are configured to allow booting to other operating systems might have to make sure that the system pagefile is wiped clean when this system shuts down. This ensures that sensitive information from process memory that might go into the pagefile is not available to an unauthorized user who manages to directly access the pagefile.

This security setting controls whether User Interface Accessibility (UIAccess or UIA) programs can automatically disable the secure desktop for elevation prompts being used by a standard user.

If you enable this setting, UIA programs including Windows Remote Assistance can automatically disable the secure desktop for elevation prompts. Unless you have also disabled elevation prompts, the prompts will appear on the interactive user's desktop instead of the secure desktop.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, the secure desktop can only be disabled by the user of the interactive desktop or by disabling the ""User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation"" setting.

UIA programs are designed to interact with Windows and application programs on behalf of a user. This setting allows UIA programs to bypass the secure desktop to increase usability in certain cases, but allowing elevation requests to appear on the regular interactive desktop instead of the secure desktop increases your security risk.

Since UIA programs must be able to respond to prompts regarding security issues, such as the UAC elevation prompt, UIA programs must be highly trusted. In order to be considered trusted, a UIA program must be digitally signed. By default, UIA programs can be run only from the following protected paths:
                ..\Program Files\ (and subfolders)
                ..\Program Files (x86)\ (and subfolders, in 64-bit versions of Windows only)
..\Windows\System32\

The requirement to be in a protected path can be disabled by the ""User Account Control: Only elevate UIAccess applications that are installed in secure locations"" setting.

While this setting applies to any UIA program, it will be used primarily in certain Windows Remote Assistance scenarios. The Windows Remote Assistance program in Windows Vista is a UIA program.

If a user requests remote assistance from an administrator and the remote assistance session is established, any elevation prompts appear on the interactive user's secure desktop and the administrator's remote session is paused. To avoid pausing the remote administrator¡¯s session during elevation requests, ,the user may select the ""llow IT Expert to respond to User Account Control prompts"" check box when setting up the remote assistance session. However, selecting this check box itself requires  that the interactive user respond to an elevation prompt on the secure desktop. If the interactive user is a standard user, the user does not have the required credentials to allow elevation.

If you enable this setting, (""User Account Control: Allow UIAccess applications to prompt for elevation without using the secure desktop¡±), , requests for elevation are automatically sent to the interactive desktop (not the secure desktop) and also appear on the remote administrator's view of the desktop during a Windows Remote Assistance session, and the remote administrator is able to provide the appropriate credentials for elevation.

This setting does not change the behavior of the UAC elevation prompt for administrators.

,Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Restricted Groups,Restricted Groups,"Only Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003",Restricted Groups policy settings are not registry keys.,"Restricted Groups

This security setting allows an administrator to define two properties for security-sensitive groups (""restricted"" groups).

The two properties are Members and Member Of. The Members list defines who belongs and who does not belong to the restricted group. The Member Of list specifies which other groups the restricted group belongs to.

When a Restricted Groups Policy is enforced, any current member of a restricted group that is not on the Members list is removed. Any user on the Members list who is not currently a member of the restricted group is added.

You can use Restricted Groups policy to control group membership. Using the policy, you can specify what members are part of a group. Any members that are not specified in the policy are removed during configuration or refresh. In addition, the reverse membership configuration option ensures that each Restricted Group is a member of only those groups that are specified in the Member Of column.

For example, you can create a Restricted Groups policy to only allow specified users (for example, Alice and John) to be members of the Administrators group. When policy is refreshed, only Alice and John will remain as members of the Administrators group.

There are two ways to apply Restricted Groups policy:

Define the policy in a security template, which will be applied during configuration on your local computer.
Define the setting on a Group Policy object (GPO) directly, which means that the policy goes into effect with every refresh of policy. The security settings are refreshed every 90 minutes on a workstation or server and every 5 minutes on a domain controller. The settings are also refreshed every 16 hours, whether or not there are any changes.
Default: None specified.

Caution

If a Restricted Groups policy is defined and Group Policy is refreshed, any current member not on the Restricted Groups policy members list is removed. This can include default members, such as administrators.

Notes

Restricted Groups should be used primarily to configure membership of local groups on workstation or member servers.
An empty Members list means that the restricted group has no members; an empty Member Of list means that the groups to which the restricted group belongs are not specified.
